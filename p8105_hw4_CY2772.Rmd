# Problem 1: Birthday problem

simulate_birthday = function(n) {
  birthdays <- sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)

  results = replicate(num_simulations, simulate_birthday(n))
  mean(results)
})
```

```

The plot shows a sigmoid-like curve, starting very low for small groups and then rapidly increasing around group sizes of 20-30, and then leveling off near 1 (100%) for group sizes approaching 50.

# Problem 2:
```{r}
#Simulating the Data and Performing the Tests
set.seed(123)  # for reproducibility

n = 30
sigma = 5
mu_values = 1:6
num_simulations = 5000

results = data.frame()

for (mu in mu_values) {
  for (i in 1:num_simulations) {
    # Generate a dataset from N(mu, sigma^2)
    x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
    
    # Perform a one-sample t-test
    test_result = t.test(x, mu = 0)
    tidy_result = tidy(test_result)
    
    # Store the estimated mean and p-value
    results = rbind(results, data.frame(
      true_mu = mu,
      estimate = mean(x),
      p_value = tidy_result$p.value
    ))
  }
}

```

```{r}
#Calculating Power and Summarizing Results
summary_results = results %>%
  group_by(true_mu) %>%
  summarize(
    power = mean(p_value < 0.05),
    avg_estimate = mean(estimate),
    avg_estimate_rejected = mean(estimate[p_value < 0.05], na.rm = TRUE)
  )
  
summary_results

```

```{r}
#Visualization and Interpretation
#a): Plotting the Power of the Test
ggplot(summary_results, aes(x = true_mu, y = power)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Power of the One-Sample t-Test",
    x = "True Mean (µ)",
    y = "Power (Proportion of Times Null Rejected)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))

```

When the true mean diverges further from the null hypothesis value of zero, the test's power increases correspondingly. This means that as the effect size grows, the likelihood of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis also rises.

# Average estimate across all samples

  ) +

plot_avg_estimate
plot_avg_estimate_rejected

```
```{r}
ggplot(summary_results, aes(x = true_mu)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = avg_estimate, color = "All Samples")) +
  geom_point(aes(y = avg_estimate, color = "All Samples")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = avg_estimate_rejected, color = "Rejected Null")) +
  geom_point(aes(y = avg_estimate_rejected, color = "Rejected Null")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("All Samples" = "blue", "Rejected Null" = "red")) +
  labs(
    title = "Comparison of Average Estimated Mean (µ̂)",
    x = "True Mean (µ)",
    y = "Average Estimated Mean (µ̂)",
    color = "Sample Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
When considering all samples, the average estimated mean $\hat{\mu}$ closely reflects the true mean value. However, if we examine only the samples where the null hypothesis was rejected, the average estimate tends to be higher than the true mean, particularly when the true mean is small. This happens due to selection bias, as only those samples that show larger deviations from the null hypothesis are included in this subset.
